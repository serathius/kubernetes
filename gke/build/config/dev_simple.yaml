    # The official GKE policy is to *not* have any generic GCR for testing only,
    # but instead to have developers have their own. In order to push to your
    # own GCR, create a GCP project with your username and use that instead.
    #
    # NOTE: If you want to create and push GCR images to your own GCP project,
    # you have to (1) modify the configs to have images named after your own GCR
    # (and not gcr.io/gke-release-staging), and (2) uncomment the below
    # 'gcr.io/placeholder' string to match.
